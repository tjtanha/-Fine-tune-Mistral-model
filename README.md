# -Fine-tune-Mistral-model
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a lightweight Stable Diffusion model for the task of image-to-image generation. The fine-tuned model takes an input image and generates a corresponding output image with enhanced features or transformed characteristics, making it ideal for applications like style transfer, image editing, or synthesizing new image variants.

Key Features:
Lightweight Stable Diffusion Model: Fine-tunes a more compact version of the Stable Diffusion model, optimizing computational resources while maintaining quality results.
Image-to-Image Generation: Transforms an input image into an output image with the desired modifications or characteristics.
Data Preprocessing: The input data is prepared, normalized, and transformed to meet the model's requirements.
Testing and Evaluation: After fine-tuning, the model is tested on a separate dataset to evaluate its performance.
